# AJCFinalProject

This is my final project for advanced javascript concepts.

As well as my submission for the weather website on in the "Client Side Web-Dev" class.

I forgot to create another branch for my news CSS so my main holds what I did.
I created the "news.html" and added some more css styling to match my other htmls.
